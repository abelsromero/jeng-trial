This an implementation of the "Game of Life" simulation.


== Decisions

Using model as pure Java to avoid surprised with Groovy added methods and properties when Serializing/Deserialzing.
The algorithm implementation is a straight-forward approach that does not focus on performance.
Current approach would *not recommended* for a real production solution.

== Alternatives

Implement a board with all cells and store on each cell the state and number of neighbours.
This would be much more faster that calculating neighbours for every cell.

== Notes on the Interface

Two main resources have been defined:
* '/Board': contains services to create, get, and update (iterate state) of a board.
* '/Cell': contains services to  get the state of specific cells (unimplemented).

The approach is to offer the operations using simple objects and reducing the traffic.
The Board is represented by height, width and list of cells that are alive.

[source,json]
./Board/state response example
----
{"heigh":"10", "width":"10", cells: {{1,2},{2,2}}}
----

This approach help building user interfaces.

Options like sending files adds another level of complexity to deal with multi-parts, not recommended at all.

== TODO
Things that should be added:
. Fixing SpringBoot initialization (for sure)
. Improve Exception handling: currently only some basic scenarios are controlled
. Logging: currently no logging exists. Main Groovy classes use '@Log4j' to include logger without boilerplate
